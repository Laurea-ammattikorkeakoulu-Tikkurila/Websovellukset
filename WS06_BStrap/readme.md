# Introduction to Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework designed to simplify web development. It provides a collection of pre-designed components, responsive grid systems, and powerful utilities that help developers create modern, mobile-first websites quickly and efficiently. Originally developed by Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most widely used frameworks in the web development community.

With Bootstrap, you can easily build responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. Its grid system allows for flexible and consistent design, while its extensive library of components—such as buttons, modals, navigation bars, and forms—saves time and effort in coding from scratch.

Bootstrap also includes built-in support for themes and customization, enabling developers to tailor the framework to match their project's design requirements. By leveraging its CSS and JavaScript libraries, you can ensure cross-browser compatibility and a professional look for your web applications.
