# Project Overview

This project demonstrates responsive web design principles using `index.html` and `./styles/style.css`. The goal is to create a web page that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **./styles/style.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling and responsive design.

## Features

1. **Responsive Layout**:
    - Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout for various screen sizes.
    - Ensures a user-friendly experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

2. **Semantic HTML**:
    - Proper use of semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc., for better accessibility and SEO.

3. **Custom Styling**:
    - Includes custom fonts, colors, and spacing for a visually appealing design.
    - Implements a mobile-first approach for styling.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Ensure `./styles/style.css` is in the correct relative path for styling to apply.

## Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for interactivity.
- Enhance accessibility features.
